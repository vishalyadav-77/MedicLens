# MEDIC LENS

MEDIC LENS is a mobile application designed to help users easily identify and learn about medications by scanning images of medicine labels. Leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology from OCR.space, the app extracts information from scanned images and provides detailed insights about the medication, including its name, chemical composition, and uses.
